# Basic Weather Application

This is a simple weather application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specified location. It fetches weather data from an external API and displays it to the user.

## Features

- **Current Weather Display**: Users can see the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

- **Location Search**: Users can search for the weather conditions of a specific location by entering the city name or zip code.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web page and defining its content.

- **CSS**: Used for styling the user interface and making it visually appealing.

- **JavaScript**: Used for fetching weather data from the API, handling user interactions, and updating the UI dynamically.

## Usage

To use the weather application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Enter the name of the city or zip code in the search input field and press Enter or click the "Search" button. The application will fetch the current weather data for the specified location and display it on the screen.

## API Integration

This weather application integrates with a third-party weather API to fetch real-time weather data. You'll need to sign up for an API key and replace the placeholder API key in the JavaScript code with your own API key to use the application.
